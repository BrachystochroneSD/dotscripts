# Twitch Shell Script

This is a simple script that use the twitch api to access streams on twitch without:
  + Open a Browser
  + Go to the Twitch website by typing on the address bar or clicking on your bookmark
  + Mute all the crap video that autostart on the front page of twitch
  + See all the shitty ads
  + Lost 2 minutes of your life just to check if your favorite streamer is live.

All you have to do is run this script with one of the two options
  + twitchscript --live: if you want to check the list of your favorite streamer that are online
  + twitchscript --game: If you want to check the stream on for a certain game.
