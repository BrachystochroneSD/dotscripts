# Youtube search Shell Script

I was sick of going to youtube with all of its adds and awfuls recommanded videos with horrible clickbait titles. Then I wrote this simple bash script to access youtube search.

Just Run it, a dmenu prompt will pop and you can search anything you want on youtube. No needs to set up an account.

You can search for an specific channel with the channel options.

# Dependencies:
  + Bash 4
  + mpv (0.14.0)
  + youtube-dl
  + [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/)
  + internet connection (of course.)

# Parameters:
  + youtube api-key (more infos on https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)
